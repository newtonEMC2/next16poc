# Explanation: Why You See `200 OK (from memory cache)` Instead of `304 Not Modified`

## What “200 OK (from memory cache)” Means

When your browser loads a resource, it often stores it in **memory cache** (RAM). When a later page load needs the same resource, the browser checks whether it can trust the cached copy.

If the cached copy is still considered **fresh**, the browser:

* Does **not** contact the server
* Returns the resource directly from memory
* Shows the original status code (`200 OK`) with a note indicating the source:

```
200 OK (from memory cache)
```

This is the fastest possible retrieval method.

## Why You *Didn’t* See a `304 Not Modified`

A `304` response only appears when the browser asks the server to confirm whether its cached copy is still valid.

That process looks like:

1. Browser sends a **conditional request** using headers such as:

   * `If-Modified-Since`
   * `If-None-Match`
2. Server checks if the file changed.
3. If unchanged, server replies:

```
304 Not Modified
```

But in your case, the browser **never asked** the server. Why? Because it already knew the cached copy was still valid.

## Why the Browser Skipped Validation

Several caching conditions allow the browser to skip making a request entirely:

### ### 1. Cache-Control Allows It

If the response provides headers such as:

* `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000`
* `Cache-Control: immutable`
* `Cache-Control: public`

Then the browser knows:

> “I should trust this cached copy until its max-age expires.”

### 2. The Cached Resource Has Not Expired

If the `max-age` timer hasn't run out, the browser considers the file **fresh**.

### 3. Memory Cache Rules

Browsers aggressively reuse in-memory cache during:

* Hard reloads
* Normal reloads
* SPA navigation
* Returning to a tab

So they often skip network requests entirely.

| Situation                  | Browser Action                       | What You See              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Cached copy is still fresh | Uses memory cache, no server contact | `200 (from memory cache)` |
| Cache must be validated    | Browser sends conditional request    | `304 Not Modified`        |
| Cache expired or disabled  | Browser downloads again              | `200 OK` (normal)         |

## In One Sentence

**You didn’t see a 304 because the browser already knew the cached version was valid and never contacted the server.**
